at the end, the project says that there is a failure of 2 tests, and a completion of 2. What I think this means is that some of the code does work, while others have syntax or logic errors. The traceback error does show us exactly where the errors are, so we can re-read them to understand the mistakes. The test fails because the actual result does not match the expected result, as indicated by the AssertionError: Fraction(9, 10) != 1 message. This discrepancy highlights that the sum function did not correctly compute the sum of the fractions provided in the test case.
